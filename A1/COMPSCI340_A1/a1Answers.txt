How to run the program:
1. just input python3 a1.py < testn.txt  where n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. For example, python3 a1.py < test1.txt
2. some undesirable things may affect the result, so please try to reset the terminal every time you finished one test.
3. please try to execute the command when the terminal window is maximum. Otherwise, it may cause errors.



Q1. If it is a LIFO stack-based dispatcher. It means that the dispatcher will choose P4 first.
So the Gantt chart should be:

|  P4 |    P3   |  P2 |    P1   |
0     5        14    18        26

In this case, the average waiting time is:

(0 + 5 + 14 + 18)/4 = 37/4 = 9.25 milliseconds



Q2. Because a real system has clock interrupt, system call, external interrupt, an operating system can decide during these points
to kill/terminate a process. However, a Python tread implementation does not have these things, it means that it does not know when 
is the proper time to kill/terminate a process safely. So we need to add these code to check the process' state.
